# Event Types & Booking

## What are Event Types?

Event Types are the different kinds of meetings you offer to your guests. Each event type has:

- **Title**: The name of your meeting (e.g., "30 Minute Consultation")
- **Duration**: How long the meeting will last
- **Description**: What the meeting is about
- **URL**: A unique link you can share with others

## Creating an Event Type

1. Go to **Event Types** in your dashboard
2. Click **New Event Type**
3. Fill in the details:
   - Give it a clear title
   - Choose a short URL slug (e.g., "30min")
   - Add a description to help guests understand the purpose
   - Set the duration
4. Click **Create Event Type**

## Sharing Your Booking Link

Once you create an event type, you'll get a shareable link like:
```
https://event.me/yourusername/30min
```

Share this link with anyone who wants to book time with you!

## How Bookings Work

When someone visits your booking link:

1. They see your event type details
2. They select a date and time (based on your availability)
3. They enter their name, email, and any notes
4. They confirm the booking
5. Both of you receive a confirmation
